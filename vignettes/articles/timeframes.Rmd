## Time cameras are operating

The next ingredient in the density calculation is calculating the total time that the camera deployments are operating. This is done by day, as including partial days (down to the hour, minute, seconds, microseconds, etc) would only have a miniscule effect on resulting density estimates. 

For many cameras, the total operating time is simply the numbers of days between the day of initial set-up to the day of final collection. However, some cameras fail before they are picked up, most often because they run out of memory or battery power after taking many pictures of cows, wind-blown vegetation, or occasionally perching birds. Other cameras fail because they fall over or are knocked over by an animal (primarily cows, although sometimes other creatures, too - see Figure 1). We use specific criteria for determining when a camera is too displaced to use: (i) if the 5-m pole is no longer in the image field, and/or (ii) if the camera is tilted >30° from horizontal. As described in the [previous section](), the position of the camera matters a great deal when accounting for the effective detection distance, so we would not want to count images when this position was compromised.

In WildTrax, the status of the camera field of view can be explicitly tagged. Defaulting to 'WITHIN', the tagger can change it to 'Out of Range' to indicate when a camera is no longer surveying the intended area. `abmi.camera.extras` provides a helper function, `ace_trunc_timeframe` to adjust camera timeframes when a camera deployment is ended prematurely. 

```{r}

library(abmi.camera.extras)

# Read in ABMI 2018 as example data - downloaded directly from the WildTrax website.
df_abmi2018 <- read_csv("ABMI_2018_WILDTRAX_REPORT.csv") %>%
  # Select relevant columns
  select(project, year, location, date_detected, common_name, field_of_view)

head(df_abmi2018, n = 10)

# Get camera timeframes, adjusting for field of view issues
range <- ace_trunc_timeframe(df_abmi2018,
                             dep_col = location,
                             date_col = date_detected,
                             trunc_col = field_of_view,
                             end = "END - Last Good Image in FOV",
                             start = "START - First Good Image in FOV")
```

Let's check whether we properly adjusted the deployment knocked over by the black bear in the figure above.

```{r}

range[range$name == "OG-ABMI-521-52", ]

```

Yes, it looks like the latest photo we will include in this camera's operating time is the one prior to the bear knocking the camera over (taken at `2018-07-13 16:23:57`). 

Sometimes a camera will be re-established during a mid-season visit or simply when the camera tilts back into it's original place (e.g. if it is on a post that cows lean on), leading to a gap in operating time for the camera. This can also be dealt with in WildTrax, using the field of view tag to indicate the last good image ('END - Last Good Image in FOV') and the subsequent start when images become good to use again ('START - First Good Image in FOV'). The `ace_inter_pairs()` function can be used to pull out the time periods between an 'END' and a subsequent (re)'START'. It returns a dataframe formatted as end/start pairs in separate rows, which can be used as an input in the `ace_summarise_tbd()` (next in this 'workflow', and described below). 

```{r}

# Again, we'll use ABMI 2018.

For many cameras, the total operating time is simply the time from just after the initial set-up to just before the final collection. However, some cameras fail before they are picked up, most often because they run out of memory or battery power after taking many pictures of cows, vegetation or occasionally perching birds. Other cameras fail because they fall over or are knocked over by cows. We use specific criteria for determining when a camera is too displaced to use – if the 5m pole is no longer in the image field, or the camera is tilted >30° from horizontal. Some of those may be re-established either during a mid-season visit or simply when the camera tilts back (e.g. if it is on a post that cows lean on), leading to a gap in operating time for the camera.

The time that each ABMI camera was operating are illustrated in the plots below. Many off-grid cameras, which target specific habitat types to improve habitat models or address other specific questions, or non-ABMI studies incorporated into the ABMI database, are set out at different times on-grid cameras. Recent years have included some cameras that were deployed in the fall and left out through the winter and following summer. Variation in start and end dates has increased over the four years, due to operational logistics (crew availability and site access). Cameras in the south-central part of the province were more likely to have short operating times because of cows. Besides creating different total operating times that need to be included in the density estimates, the varying deployment periods interact with seasonal variation in detectability of different species, which we need to address in the analysis.
