\title{Subset ABMI camera deployments by a specified spatial area of interest}
\usage{
ace_get_cam(aoi, cols = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{aoi}{The area of interest as an sf, sfc, or sp (SpatialPolygonsDataFrame) object}

\item{cols}{character; indicates which columns (attributes) from x to be appended to the deployments dataframe}

\item{keep.all}{logical; if TRUE all deployments are kept, otherwise only those within x are kept}
}
\value{
a dataframe of deployments within the supplied area of interest
}
\description{
Subset ABMI camera deployments by a specified spatial area of interest

\examples{
library(sf)
# Example aoi of four Wildlife Management Units (WMUs) in Alberta:
wmu_sample <- st_read(system.file("extdata/wmu_sample.shp", package = "abmi.camera.extras"))
# Obtain ABMI deployments in sample WMUs, keeping unit name
wmu_sample_deployments <- ace_get_cam(wmu_sample, cols = "WMUNIT_NAM")
# Plot results
wmu_sample <- st_transform(wmu_sample, "+init=epsg:4326")
plot(wmu_sample_deployments$geometry, pch = 21, cex = 0.7, col = "blue", bg = "gray80")
plot(wmu_sample$geometry, border = "gray20", col = NA, add = TRUE)
